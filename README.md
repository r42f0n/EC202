3.    Consider   a   game   with   two   players,   L =   {1,   2},   with   actions   S1    = S2    =
{Bear,   Ninja,   Warrior,   Hunter}.   The   Bear   (B)   beats   Ninja   (N),   Ninja   beats   Warrior   (W),
Warrior   beats   Hunter   (H),   Hunters   beats   Bear,   Bear   ties   with   Warrior,   Ninja   ties   with   Hunter,   and   every   action   ties   with   itself.   A   win   gives   a   player   a   payoﬀ   equal   to   1,   lose   gives   -1,   and   a   tie   gives   a   payoﬀ   equal   to   0.   The   normal-form   representation   takes   the   following   form.

9.    Consider   the   following   “war   of   attrition”   game,   which   is   played   over   discrete   periods   of   time.   Player   1   and   Player   2   can   play   Stop   (S)   or   Continue   (C).   We   can   represent   the   game   in normal   form   as   follows:
1, 2                          S                          C
S                           0,0                      0,20

Otherwise,   the   game continues   into   the   next   period.   Suppose   the   players   discount   payoﬀs   between   periods according   to   the   discount   factor   δ   ∈   (0, 1).   What   is   the   probability   that   the   game   will   be played   exactly   two   times   if   the   players   play   the   mixed-strategy   Nash   equilibrium?       (8   marks)

A   proﬁle   of   actions   is   written   (x,y,   z) where   the   ﬁrst   entry   is   the   action   of   Player   1,   the   second   entry   is   the   action of   Player   2   and   the   third   entry   is   the   action   of   Player   3.

The   payoﬀs   in   the   extensive   form   above   are   denominated   in   VNM   utilities.    Player   1   moves   ﬁrst   and   can   play   L   or   R.    If   Player   1   plays   L,    Player   1   and   Player   2   will   play   the   simultaneous-move   game   with   actions   S1    = S2    =   {H,   T}.    If   Player      1   plays   R,   Player   1   and Player   2   will   play   a   sequential-move   game   with   Player   2   choosing   from   the   set   of   actions   S2,      =   {C,   D},   followed   by   Player   1   selecting   from   S1,      =   {C,   D}.   The   payoﬀs   to   each   player   is indicated   at   the   bottom   of   the   game   tree   with   Player   1’s   payoﬀs   being   the   ﬁrst   entry.

When   a   cell   is   selected,   each   player   is   told   by   the   ‘umpire’   to   play   corresponding   to   pure
strategy.    Each   Player   is   told   what   to   play   but   not   what   the   other   player   is   told   although   the   probability   distribution   is   common   knowledge.   Which   statement   is   true?       (6   marks)
A.    The   mechanism   proposed   by   the   ‘umpire’   cannot   be   supported   in   a   correlated equilibrium   because   Player   1   has   a   unilateral   incentive   to   deviate.

C.    The   mechanism   proposed   by   the   ‘umpire’   cannot   be   supported   in   a   correlated
equilibrium   because   both   Player   1   and   Player   2   each   have   a   unilateral   incentive   to   deviate.
D.    The   mechanism   proposed   by   the   ‘umpire’   can   be   supported   in   a   correlated   equilibrium and   the   expected   payoﬀ to   either   player   in   the   correlated   equilibrium   exceeds   their expected   payoﬀ   in   the   mixed   strategy   Nash   equilibrium.
E.    The   mechanism   proposed   by   the   ‘umpire’   can   be   supported   in   a   correlated   equilibrium.   Player   1   gets   a   higher   expected   payoﬀ   in   the   correlated   equilibrium   than   in   the   mixed   strategy   Nash   equilibrium   but   Player   2   gets   a   higher   expected   payoﬀ   in   the mixed-strategy   Nash   equilibrium   than   in   the   correlated   equilibrium.

The   individual’s   utility   can   be   represented   as   u(xi   ) =   √xi   ,         where   i   = b,g.

B.    There   is   a   pure-strategy   Nash   equilibrium   in   which   Player    1   selects   x   = 2   and   in   which   Player   2   selects   y   =   1   but   this   equilibrium   is   not   unique.
C.    There   is   a   pure-strategy   Nash   equilibrium   in   which   Player    1   selects   x   = 2   and   in   which   Player   2   selects   y   =   1   and   there   is   a   mixed   strategy   Nash   equilibrium   in   which   each player   selects   each   action   with   equal   probability.
