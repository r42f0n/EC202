1. Ram   is   faced   with   a   lottery   which   pays   £100   in   a   good   state   and   £0   in   a   bad   state   with   each state   occuring   with   equal   probability.    Ram   says   he   prefers   to   receive   £60   for   certain   rather than   taking   the   lottery.   Which   statement   is   true? (6 marks) 
A.      Ram   is   risk   loving.
B.      Ram   is   risk   averse.
C.      Ram   is   risk   neutral.
D.      Ram   is   not   risk   loving.
E.    We   have   insuﬃcient   information   to   determine   whether   Ram   is   risk   averse,   risk   loving   or   risk   neutral.
2. Consider   Hugo   whose   preferences   can   be   represented   by   the   following   utility   function:

where   x   is   wealth.   Which   statement   is   true? (6 marks) 
A.    Hugo’s   coeﬃcient   of   relative    risk   aversion   is   the   same   regardless   of   his   level   of   wealth.
B.    Hugo’s   coeﬃcient   of   absolute      risk   aversion   is   constant.
C.    Hugo   would   choose   £30   for   certain   over   a   lottery   that   would   pay   £100   or   £0   with   equal probability.
D.    Hugo   would   choose   £20   for   certain   over   a   lottery   that   would   pay   £100   or   £0   with   equal probability.
E.    The   utility   function   can   represent   both   risk   averse   and   risk   loving   preferences.
3. Consider   a   game   with   two   players,   L =   {1,   2},   with   actions   S1    = S2    ={Rock,   Paper,   Scissors,   Well}.   The   Rock   (R)   beats   Scissors   (S)   and   is   beaten   by   Paper   (P)      and   Well   (W);   P   beats   R   and   W   and   is   beaten   by   S;   S   beats   P   and   is   beaten   by   R   and   W   ;   W   beats   R   and   S   and   is   beaten   by   P.    Every   action   draws   with   itself.    A   win   gives   a   player   a payoﬀ   equal   to   1,   lose   gives   -1,   and   a   tie   gives   a   payoﬀ   equal   to   0.

D.    The   only   Pareto   eﬃcient   outcome   of   the   game   is      (D,   R).
E.    There   are   two   pure-strategy   Nash   equilibria   of   this   game   –    (U,   L)   and   (M,   M) –   but only   the   latter   is   Pareto   eﬃcient.

D.    There   is   a   mixed-strategy   Nash   equilibrium   in   which   Player   2   plays   R   with   probability ρ2    =   1   and   Player   1   plays   U   with   probability   ρ   1 = 10/1 .

Nature   draws   a   type   ti   ,   from   the   set   of   types,   T   =   {t1   ,   t2   }.    Each   type,   t1    and   t2      are   drawn   with   equal   probability.

Assume   that   Player   1   and   Player   2   discount   the   future   by   δ   ∈   [0, 1).
For   which   values   of   the   discount   factor   δ   will   the   players   be   able   to   sustain   cooperation   if   the game   is   repeated   inﬁnitely   many   times?   Assume   that   any   deviation   from   the   alternating

When   a   cell   is   selected,   each   player   is   told   by   the   ‘umpire’   to   play   corresponding   to   pure strategy.    Each   player   is   told   what   to   play   but   not   what   the   other   player   is   told   although   the   probability   distribution   is   common   knowledge.
